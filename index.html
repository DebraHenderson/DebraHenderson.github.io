        <h3>Tips</h3> <p>Tips are a way that a customer lets you know that you did above and beyond what they expected of you. We provide a fun and safe environment for their children, BUT you make the difference in the experience they have.</p>

<h3>5 Ways to Be Fun or It's the little things that mean so much.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Smile a lot
No matter if, or how behind you are, remember that every customer is important. 
You may deliver 4 or 5 moonwalks today, but they are only getting one, and they are excited about it!</li>
<li>Talk to the kids
The kids are what make our jobs possible. Sometimes they are overexcited to the point of insanity, but showing them a little attention not only makes their day happier, it reminds you of why this is such a wonderful business to be in. </li>
<li>Parents who observe you being nice to their kids are much more likely to recommend our company to other parents, and tip you.</li>
<li>Bring a Little Something Extra for the Birthday Child
We provide a gift for the birthday child and siblings. Will they remember you? You bet!</li>
<li>Tell Jokes
You don't have to be original- find 4-5 jokes that work for you and while you are setting up, tell them to the kids who are anxiously waiting to start bouncing.</li>
<li>Bring a Little Something Extra for the Parents 
We also provide whistles, certificates and pens for the parents, remember to give them to the parents along with a few business cards for their family and friends. 
Mention that anyone who uses their name to rent from us gets a $25.00 discount.</li>

<h3>Why Worry About Being Fun? It's Good for YOU!</h3>
<p>Staying positive and acting happy (even when you are stressed) actually helps to relieve stress. Often you can turn a bad mood around when you see the delighted reactions of the children and family at the event. This can be a stressful business- focusing on fun helps to keep you motivated.</p>
<h3>It's Good for Business!</h3>
<p>In a family-oriented business, personal impressions count for a lot. Being fun can make the difference between a "yeah, we had a moonwalk for the party" and a "you have GOT to get your next moonwalk from this company, they are great!"</p>
<h3>Tell them your name, they may ask for you next time!</h3>
<p>WE promise great service and then we go the extra mile to deliver the fun! You are a very important part of our team. We want to take a moment to acknowledge and appreciate Outstanding team members, who go above and beyond, consistently. </p> 
<h3>Do you know what our 100 club is?</h3>
    <p> Only our best staff are members of the 100 club. They are our current MVP team members - and they got into this prestious club by getting a #100.00 tip at one party! It is not a mistake, they earn those tips by going up and beyond customer expectation! </p>

        <p>Here is a little story from one of our renter's who took the Air Castles And Slides' on line training program;</p>

<p>I just wanted to say thank you for such a professional and well run company. The rental process was easy, efficient and well worth it.  The online training was very helpful.</p>  

<p>I read the material and thankfully was well prepared when we lost power.</p>  

<p>The castle began to deflate and parents panicked. However, as a Certified Supervisor (which I bragged about the entire party), I was able to keep the parents calm while having enough time to get the kids out safely.</p>  

<p>Prior to the outage, parents teased that I had to take a test and I was so serious about my whistle. After the incident, we all appreciated my ability to handle the situation calmly.</p>
 
<p>Thanks again, the castle was a huge success.</p>

          <p>We asked staff from last year what they wished they knew before they 'found out the hard way.</p>'

 <h4>Bathroom</h4>
 <p>Use the bathroom before we begin work. We do not enter clients homes, so plan ahead. Use the bathroom at service stations when we stop for gas.</p>

 <h4>Food</h4>
<p>We are not invited guests. We do not enter clients homes for any reason, so plan ahead. Bring a bagged lunch, pleanty of water and purchase water, food and snacks at service stations that have convience stores when we stop for gas.</p>

<h4>Rest</h4>
 <p>Get plenty of sleep the night before, you will need it.
 This is very Physical Work, your muscles will get a workout!
 Rest in the delivery vehicle between deliveries.
 Some times we work very Late picking up the units.</p>

<h4>Shirt off your back</h4>
 <p> Bring an extra T-Shirt so you can feel fresh after lunch, an in-between deliveries.</p>

<h4>Weekly Hours</h4>
 <p> Delivery Schedule is determined late Thursday or Friday, so specific working hours and locations are not known until then. Who will be working will be known earlier in the week.</p> 

<h4>CHECK YOUR EMAIL and respond to us during the week.</h4> 
<p>On Monday send in your weekend hours. By Monday or Tuesday let us know if you are available for the weekend coming up. On Wednesday and Thursday check your assignments and schedule.</p> 

<h4>Confirm you read and understood the emails you receive from the office.</h4> 

<h4>In NJ, inflatable play units are called 'moonwalks'</h4>
<p>We prefer 'Air Castles', 'Obstale Courses',  'Inflatable Slides'  and 'Combos' which are the terms we will use to describe the inflatable units from Air Castles And Slides, LLC.</p> 

<h4>Continuously Supervised</h4>
<p>Although Air Castles and Slides are completely insured, YOU still need to be responsible and make sure All children are continuously supervised while any child is in, using, or around, any of our Air Castles and Slides inflatable rentals,  including games and all rental machines.</p>

<h4>Familiar</h4>
<p>You need to be familiar with all aspects of our business. Our goal is to have the 'magic' of Disney World  for everyone who rents from us. </p>

<h4>We Want</h4>
<p> bright, happy, perky, and intelligent staff who can speak good English and problem solve on their feet, with warm, approachable smiles, impeccable personal grooming, clean uniforms and a winning, 'sure, no problem' attitude.</p>

<h4>Positive Corporate Image</h4>
<p>We have a positive corporate image and we want to protect it!</p>
 
 <h4>Staff Uniform</h4>
 <p>The uniform includes a solid color Royal Blue T-Shirt or for working interview or new staff solid white with no writing on it. Royal blue is the color of the staff shirts. Once awarded a staff shirt you need to wear it while working.</p>

 <p>We prefer black pants, and we know they may be difficult to get late in the season so plan ahead. Khaki is also permitted as staff pant colors. Jeans are not appropriate. Clothing must fit you correctly.</p>

 <p>Shorts are not encouraged, (even in the summer,) because pants are safer!</p>

 <p>Back braces, knee pads and goggles are available for your protection</p>
