<h2>Floss Boss Cotton Candy Machine</h2>

 <h4>FREE SUPPLIES COME WITH THIS MACHINE...... 1- CONTAINER of  SILLY NILLY Traditional Flossugar AND cotton candy cones!</h4>
 <p>Cotton candy flavor sugar flossFloss Boss is a full size, Cotton Candy machine at a very low rental price. • Easy to operate.. . plugs in anywhere. Floss Boss with Non-Metallic Floss Bowl is a great machine. It’s the most dependable Cotton Candy machine in the industry. Solid state heat control, high capacity spinner head, and cool running operation makes it easy. It is recommendedFloss About Cart that this (and all other floss machines,) be operated with some type of floss bubble to protect from flying sugar crystals in case someone overloads the spinner head. We supply the 'double bubble' for maximum protection. The Double Bubble, the ultimate in protection – simply sits on the top rim of the 26" (66 cm) outside diameter floss bowl.</p>

<p> All Gold Medal Cotton Candy machines are equipped with four carbon brushes and contact with the brass slip rings – in a slightly unbalanced sugar load, this extra hardware helps prevent damage to the brass. Don’t try to “push” these single heating element floss machines too hard – when you turn the heat “up,” you may cause too much heat – carbon will form in the heating element and clog up the ribbons, eventually reducing production completely. Single ribbon machine, 1080 Watts, 9 Amps, 120 Volts. </p>
 
<p> We provide a cotton candy rolling cart, (pictured on left,) which puts the cotton candy at the perfect height for making this delicious treat.</p>

 <h2>History and Science of Cotton Candy!</h2>

 <img src="img/cottonCandyMachineandBubble.jpg" alt="Air Castles And Slides Cotton Candy photo. Specific details will come later." class="img-responsive">
 

 <p>Cotton candy looks like pillows of wool but it melts in your mouth like a snowflake. Silly Nilly is the traditional flavor and pink is the usual color, OK, cotton candy may lack the "wow" factor of many other carnival sights, but it does have its own kind of magic: the magic of food science. Cotton candy wasn't always kids' stuff. It goes back to the banquet tables of the European aristocracy and a time when sugar was so rare that it was kept under lock and key. At that time, spun sugar was an expensive, labor-intensive endeavor and was not generally available to the average person.</p>

<p>Common table sugar changes when heated. Pastry chefs in 15th-century Venice created masterpieces with spun sugar. They drizzled the golden syrup and worked the warm, pliable sugar threads into different shapes and even entire scenes, Their artistry decorated plates of preserved fruits and other desserts. Spun sugar was a treat for the wealthy—the two essential ingredients, sugar and time, were luxuries for most people.</p>

<p>Cotton candy has traveled the world under a variety of names. It's "candy floss" in Great Britain, "fairy floss" to the mates in Australia, !a barbe a papa, or "Papa's beard," to the French, and zucchero fiiato, or "sugar thread," in Italy. The name "cotton candy" didn't become popular until the 1920s.</p>

<p>Machine-spun cotton candy was invented in 1897 by the dentist William Morrison and confectioner John C. Wharton and first introduced to a wide audience at the 1904 World's Fair as "Fairy Floss" with great success, selling 68,655 boxes at the then-high price of 25¢, half the cost of admission to the fair (equivalent to $6 today). T Patton of Ringling Bros Circus, had one in 1900.</p>

<p>Modern cotton candy is made by heating a part of the machine and forcing the liquid sugar out little holes while part of the machine spins very fast. The bowl catches all the cotton candy as the machine spins. The finished product is fine and fluffy, almost ethereal.</p>

<h2>In Science News Cotton candy is helping researches find a way to re-grow human tissue, They noticed how cotton candy filaments mimicked the capillary system.</h2>

<p>Cotton Candy machines can be rented for private parties today which make the same Cotton Candy at circuses, street fairs and carnivals. The modern cotton candy machine heatsg a part of the machine and spins sugar very quickly pushing the heated sugar out through slits in the rotating head. The spun sugar is caught in a big bowl topped with a ‘double bubble’ because one bowl collects it while the upside down bowl or cover protects the children watching the spinning process The operator twirls the floss onto cotton candy cones to make it easier to hold. Air Castles And Slides at AirCastleRentals.com can rent you a cotton candy machine for your party - just like at the Jersey shore boardwalk!
